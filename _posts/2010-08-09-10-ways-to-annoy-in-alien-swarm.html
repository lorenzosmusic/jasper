Our favorite is the example they point out at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGECFx4K7qo#t=2m15s">2:15 min</a>&nbsp;into the video. That made us laugh pretty hard.<br /><br />It's cool to see our stuff being used out in the wild. And thanks to the folks over at <a href="http://machinima.com/">machinima.com</a> for not only promoting us as a <b>creative commons music source</b> but using it as well. We would love to see more people use our stuff in new and interesting ways. If you want to, go ahead and lets see what you come up with.<br /><fb:like></fb:like>
