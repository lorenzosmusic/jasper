Sure I make music under creative commons licenses, but I like to talk about it too.<br /><br />Last year I started a podcast called <a href="http://www.musicmanumit.com/">Music Manumit</a> with <b>Doug Whitfield</b>, another CC music enthusiast, that was part talking to musicians and others involved in the <a class="zem_slink" href="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="homepage" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> movement and part playing music released using it. It's fun to do and I get to meet a lot of really cool people because of it. We've even talked with&nbsp;<b>Eric Steuer</b>, Creative Director at <b>Creative Commons</b> and Board member of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://cashmusic.org/" rel="homepage" title="CASH Music">CASH Music</a>.<br /><br />Well, one of my favorite sources of music in the realm is the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">freemusicarchive.org</a> run by <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/member/jason">Jason Sigal</a> of <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.wfmu.org/" rel="homepage" title="WFMU">WFMU</a>. And recently we were made <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/MusicManumit/">curators</a> for music on the site to add more CC Music artists to it ourselves. So I'm pretty psyched about that and just thought I'd share. There's a lot of good music out there owned by the artists and in a sense, by the fans.<br /><br />One of our posts was recently a featured item on the home page (linking to the article itself cuz it won't be the featured post forever).<br /><a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/MusicManumit/blog/Isaac_Graham_and_the_Reds">Free Music Archive: Isaac Graham and the Reds</a><br /><div class="zemanta-related"><h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em; margin: 1em 0 0 0;">Related articles</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2011/05/how-we-talked-amanda-palmer-into.html">How We Talked Amanda Palmer Into Releasing Under Creative Commons</a> (lorenzosmusic.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2011/05/fans-animated-short-film-survival-of.html">A fans animated short film "Survival of the fittest" featuring our music</a> (lorenzosmusic.com)</li></ul></div><div class="zemanta-pixie" style="height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;"><img alt="" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=edb6acad-65bc-48be-8645-9df7cef92bfc" style="border: none; float: right;" /></div>
