It's an event where several bands from Madison WI got together one night to cover songs by other Madison bands.<br /><br />We got ourselves a copy someone made of it and decided that we would let you get your own copy... Free!<br />I mean why not really?<br />We'll bring it to you since you might not have been able to get there yourself.<br /><br />Most of the songs are originals, but we did cover a few of our favorites that made it on to this recording.<br />Those songs are:<br /><b>Track 3</b> - Dust and Shadows by <b>Ladybeard&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size: x-small;">(the singer joins us on stage and plays&nbsp;tambourine)</span><br /><b>Track 10</b> - H-Bomb by <b>The Skintones</b><br /><br />I'm told that this recording was made on a TASCAM digital recorder that was placed on the stage.<br /><br />Happy bootlegging!<br />And if you're gonna do it, why not share it with your friends?
