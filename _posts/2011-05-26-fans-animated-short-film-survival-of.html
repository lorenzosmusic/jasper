<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24156392?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/24156392">Survival of the fittest</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user5470489">Artur Przysiecki</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />About a month ago we were contacted on Facebook by Arthur from Germany asking if he could use our music in a movie short he was making. He had found us on <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/Lorenzo%27s_Music_%282%29">Jamendo</a> while looking for creative commons music for the project, a 3D animated short for his diploma thesis.<br /><br />It's a pretty damn good film! Nice work!<br /><br />The film is released under the Non-Commercial, Non-Derivative license <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/" rel="homepage" title="Creative Commons licenses">CC-BY-NC-ND</a> because the song "<a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/track/391002">Balrog Boogie</a>" by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myspace.com/diabloswingorchestra">Diablo Swing Orchestra</a> was under that license. He asked us if he could use our music under the same, which we of course said yes.<br /><br />Enjoy.
