It's that time of year again. And our version of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman" from years back is popping up on the podcasts again. <br /><br />Here it is on the Sleeperberth Cast, described as "Where tired Truckers need to go before they go to hell." Check it out.<br /><blockquote cite="http://www.sleeperberth.com/2007/12/09/385/">Topics Covered: The “proper” use of chains. More on Monovision and other types of multifocal contact lenses. You Tube and the desire for technology to “just work” as opposed to geeking on it.</blockquote><cite cite="http://www.sleeperberth.com/2007/12/09/385/"><a href="http://www.sleeperberth.com/2007/12/09/385/">SC #205 Demon Stratin’ On Yule Toobin’ » Sleeperberth Cast</a></cite><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock" target="_new">Flock</a></p>
