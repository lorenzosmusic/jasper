The text is cryptic emphasizing the inability to decide what you really want in life despite everything.<br />- "<a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2011/01/new-year-and-new-song.html">Roulette</a>" the song plays with Jimi Hendrix's initial approach and then throws himself on the Modest Mouse preparing an unusual chorus when Tom jumps from right to left just as the ball of the roulette at the casino in the text that is a sad metaphor for the case and that in turn serves to give a name to the 'inability to control our lives.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.resetradio.net/musica/riflettori-su-lorenzos-music/">article</a>&nbsp;is in italian but if you aren't able to read that you can check out the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.resetradio.net/musica/riflettori-su-lorenzos-music/&amp;act=url">english translated version here</a>.<br /><div class="zemanta-pixie" style="height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">(<a href="http://www.resetradio.net/musica/riflettori-su-lorenzos-music/">click this link</a> to listen to the broadcast on the top left of the page.)</span></div>
