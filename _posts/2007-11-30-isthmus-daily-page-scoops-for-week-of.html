An excerpt from a recent Isthmus article about our netcasts.<br /><blockquote cite="http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=15351">Lorenzo's Music are posting weekly netcasts to their website (www.lorenzosmusic.com) to unveil their forthcoming album, one song at a time. But the videos don't feature the band performing.<br /><br />"I'm a fan of old movies and retro commercials," explains the local rock band's lead vocalist, Tom Ray. "So I searched some public domain archives and chose a film."</blockquote><cite cite="http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=15351"><a href="http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=15351">Isthmus | The Daily Page - Scoops for the week of Nov. 30- Dec. 7</a></cite>
