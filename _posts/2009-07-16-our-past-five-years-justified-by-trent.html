Back in 2005 when we released our album "<a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2005/08/solamente-tres-palabras-2005.html">Solamente Tres Palabras</a>" we built our band on a new model. An internet/Creative Commons model. <br /><br />I was turned on to the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons License</a> by the new medium of podcasting. <br /><br />It was a simple concept, let people download your music, play it and use it as long as they share-alike giving credit to the artist. So you weren't just giving them your music. You were giving it to them and asking that they give credit and point others back to you while retaining your rights, in not so many words. You can view the full words of our license <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">here</a>.<br /><br />Later, I saw this movie <a href="http://www.ripremix.com/">RIP! A Remix Manifesto</a> at a local <a href="http://openeverything.wik.is/Madison,_WI">Open Everything Event</a>. The movie proved to me that the copyright model as we know it today is broken and corrupted. <br /><br />Music should be in the hands of the artist. And with the internet our websites <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">ARE</span> our labels.<br /><br />This means, we say what we want to do with our music and can get it to the people under our own rules. Promotion is our tool that we control thanks to social networking and the fantastic people that create these services for us.<br /><br />I've been thinking this for 5 years now and since then we've also released our newest album "<a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2008/08/bazar-2008.html">BAZAR</a>" under the same model.<br /><br />Recently I was sent a link to this post that Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails had put on his own website.<br /><a href="http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?30,767183">my thoughts on what to do as a new / unknown artist</a> <br /><br />Established artists are starting to get it. That's good news for everyone.<br /><br />This made us think about what we've been doing and try to push it even further. <br />We are working on new songs right now and plan to release them as singles on this website as well as video, special mixes and whatever we think of along the way.<br /><br />This website is going to to be.... us, creatively. <br /><br />So, stay tuned and see what happens.<div class="flockcredit" style="text-align: right; color: #CCC; font-size: x-small;">Blogged with the <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" style="color: #999; font-weight: bold;" target="_new" title="Flock Browser">Flock Browser</a></div>
