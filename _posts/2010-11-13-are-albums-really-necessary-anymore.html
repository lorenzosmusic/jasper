The problem is, that new idea gets left at just that for the time being --an idea. Mainly because the next time we get together it's back to working on the songs for the album.<br /><br />Now the other <span>matter</span> is that when we <i>do</i> finish one song for the album it sits and waits as we record, mix and master the <i>next</i> song for the album. And while we work on that... more and more songs wait for this whole&nbsp;process&nbsp;to end so they can all be released together.<br /><br />One night we we're talking about how we release all of our stuff digitally anyway. So, why do we need to wait to release these songs?<br /><br />In an internet world we think that indie bands like ourselves do not need to release songs in an old industry standard format. Why not treat the website as a label?<br /><br />What we've decided to do is, just release our songs as singles on the website as we write them. After we've got a good number of them we might just put them out as a physical release, like a cd or vinyl for a limited run to pay the bills. But there is no reason we shouldn't just be sharing the music we write as we do it. I mean, that's the point right?<br /><br />So that's our plan. Soon we will be releasing our first single from these songs.
