<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>I finally did it.&nbsp; Got rid of the Gibson 335/Fender Pro reverb and replaced 'em with a Gibson 61 SG and Star Gain Star amp.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PcR8Wy4I2P0/TAVRafuT06I/AAAAAAAAADc/ZSo1bNTwJrE/s1600/sg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PcR8Wy4I2P0/TAVRafuT06I/AAAAAAAAADc/ZSo1bNTwJrE/s320/sg.jpg" width="320" /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PcR8Wy4I2P0/TAVWzSL7AOI/AAAAAAAAADg/WLHcmY_IG0E/s1600/gainstar.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="181" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PcR8Wy4I2P0/TAVWzSL7AOI/AAAAAAAAADg/WLHcmY_IG0E/s200/gainstar.jpeg" width="200" /></a></div><br />The amp is incredibly inspiring to play, and the sound is rich, robust, unique, and, did I say rich?&nbsp; When I first got it I was like 'whoa', and then I was all like 'WTF', as in, which sound should I use?&nbsp; There is such a wide variety of tones available.&nbsp; Finally I think i settled in on a high gain creamy grit for the main distorted sound, and the rest of the tones I need I can get with foot pedals on the clean channel.<br /><br />&nbsp;This SG guitar is truly a treat.&nbsp; It seems to have riffs that just come out of it.&nbsp; Like they are trapped inside the guitar, and when I strap it on, I just release them.&nbsp; Waaay out dude?&nbsp; Not.&nbsp; Gotta see it to believe it.<br /><br />Better yet, the new EP, due this summer, has these riffs all over it.&nbsp; When it comes out, take a listen, and then you can decide and tell me if I'm <b>waaay out there, dude.</b>
