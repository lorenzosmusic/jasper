Our song "Indain Summer" from our pending album was just featured on the Insomnia Radio Podcast along with a bunch of other great artists. Head on over and give the show a listen for some great music.<br /><blockquote cite="http://insomniaradio.net/2008/06/08/insomnia-radio-156-blackbelt/"><a href="http://insomniaradio.net/2008/06/08/insomnia-radio-156-blackbelt/" title="Ninja Academy">  <img alt="Ninja Academy" border="0" src="http://insomniaradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/blackbelt2.jpg" /> </a><br />We hope you enjoy the exclusives, classic Kung Fu/Ninjitsu dialogue, and a full hour long ride through a theatrically charged show featuring some of the best music being released worldwide, as well as the corniest cinematic dialogue we could get our hands on. Enjoy, and as always, please support the artists within.</blockquote><cite cite="http://insomniaradio.net/2008/06/08/insomnia-radio-156-blackbelt/"><a href="http://insomniaradio.net/2008/06/08/insomnia-radio-156-blackbelt/">Insomnia Radio #156: Blackbelt : Insomnia Radio: Indie Music Network</a></cite>
