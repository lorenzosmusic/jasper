<img height="400" src="http://www.indiekidonline.com/thespotlight/lm_interview-large-tm.jpg" width="400" /><br />Hey people,<br />We recently did an interview over <a href="http://skype.com/">Skype</a> with Matt Galligan of <a href="http://spotlight.indiekidonline.com/">The Spotlight Podcast</a> to promote our new album "<a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2005/03/solamente-tres-palabras.html">Solamente Tres Palabras</a>".<br /><br />It was recorded with Scott, Chris, Mark and I all present (Bryan couldn't make it that night). Now, with all of us in the same room we tended to go off on many a tangent. But we did have a great time doing it. And part two of the interview was done with Jason Evangelo of <a href="http://www.insomniaradio.net/">The Insomnia Radio Podcast</a> which will be coming out in the near future. So if you can't get enough of us you can look forward to that as well.<br /><br />To download the interview <a href="http://www.indiekidonline.com/thespotlight/archives/2005/06/the_lorenzos_mu.html">click here</a><br /><br />and to subscribe to The Spotlight Podcast here's the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/thespotlight">RSS Feed</a><br /><br />And don't forget to buy our new album at our <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/store.html">online store.</a>
