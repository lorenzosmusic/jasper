You get to hear a bunch of great bands and if you have one I suggest you contact them with your music too, and tell 'em <em>"Lorenzo's Music sent ya!"</em><br /><em></em><br />Now I know some of you are probably saying, "what the hell is Podcasting?" Well you can read a description <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">here</a>. Then go to <a href="http://podcastalley.com">Podcastalley.com</a> and subscribe to some shows.
