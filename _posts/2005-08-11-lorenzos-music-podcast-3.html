But the song was done live in Mark's studio so that part still sounds good. And that's really all that matters, isn't it?<br /><br />This time we feature new/old song called "Indian Summer"<br /><br /><br />You can subscribe to the show here:<br /><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LorenzosMusicPodcast" title="Subscribe to my feed"><img src="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/images/pub/fbapix.gif" alt="Right click and save link in your podfeeder" style="border: 0pt none ;" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.odeo.com/channel/6810/view"><img src="http://www.odeo.com/img/badge-green.gif" alt="My Odeo Channel" style="border: 0pt none ;" /></a>
