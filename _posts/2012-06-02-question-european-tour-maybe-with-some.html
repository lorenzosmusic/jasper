Just a quick question...<br />We were talking at practice the other night about how in recent years a lot of our album downloads and&nbsp;purchases&nbsp;have been coming from Europe. And we thought wouldn't it be great if we could go to there and play these places even if it's just for a week long tour?<br /><br /><u>So here is our question:</u><br /><br /><b>Would it be crazy for us to start a fan funded campaign to tour Europe?</b><br />Let us know in the comments below.
