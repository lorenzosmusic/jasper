<a title="Back in the studio working on the live show for the new album" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/vfQRKo6FiGPL0i2OIgMwuQ"><br />  <img src="http://lh3.google.com/LorenzosMusic/R93_YaJkDII/AAAAAAAAAhw/wJHCrcIWyWw/s288/Lorenzo%20in%20the%20studio.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />The new album is being mastered. So we're in the studio working on the live show. We've added an organ and second guitar to the line up as well. Soon the album will be available here, free to download. Plus, a new site design is coming as well. Hopefully all will be happening real soon, so stay tuned!
