The mp3 blog <a href="http://freeshit.therealn.com/">Free Multimedia Of The Week</a> just posted a review of the band:<br /><blockquote cite="http://freeshit.therealn.com/?p=135">Lorenzo’s Music is one of those bands that manages to make every track have a different sound (kind of like the band CAKE). Making subtle but effective use of their saxophone as well as unorthodox percussion parts that utilize a range of genres they create a recognizable and solid style.</blockquote><cite cite="http://freeshit.therealn.com/?p=135"><a href="http://freeshit.therealn.com/?p=135">Lorenzo’s Music – 4 Albums « Free Multimedia Of The Week</a></cite><br /><br />Thanks to Seaword for the post and the review. <br />Check out their <a href="http://freeshit.therealn.com/">site</a> and all the great music they find each week.
