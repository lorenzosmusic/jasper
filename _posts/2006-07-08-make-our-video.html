As you all know, we have offered all of our <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/audio.html">songs for free to download on our site</a>. Well, now it's your turn to give <span style="font-style: italic;">us</span> something. We want you to make our next video.<br /><br />"what?!" you say, "How do I do that?"<br /><br />Well, it's very easy. The fact that you were able to come to this site proves you have the capabilities to do it. Let me elaborate.<br /><br /><a href="http://images.eyespot.com/images/logo_sp.gif"><img alt="logo_sp.gif" src="http://images.eyespot.com/images/logo_sp.gif" /></a><br />Go to the website <a href="http://www.eyespot.com">eyespot.com</a> and create an account. Now you're ready to make our video. (by the way, it's free!)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.eyespot.com">EyeSpot</a> let's you upload, mix, edit, add effects and other such crazy things right on their site. You don't even have to have your own footage (although we would like to see that). You can just search the site for video clips to use or you can upload your own. You can even upload video from your camera phone if you want to. (just so you know each clip you upload can only be 50 megs, but you can upload as many clips as you want to use.)<br /><br />So, just go to the <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/audio.html">audio section on our website</a> and pick a song, download it, then upload it to your eyespot account. Drag it to the audio bar in the mixer and do the same with your uploaded or saved videos (remember to mute the video clips). Then save it and send us the link at tmray02@lorenzosmusic.com and we'll post it on our site. Or contact me at my EyeSpot group at <a href="http://eyespot.com/groups/LorenzosVideoProject">http://eyespot.com/groups/LorenzosVideoProject</a><br /><br />Let us see what you think our songs should look like.<br /><br /><a href="http://digg.com/music/get_music_free..._now_make_a_video.">digg this article</a><br /><br />Just as an example here's a clip I did in like 10 min. just searching the site and at the end I uploaded a 5 second camera video from practice this week.<br /><br /><embed src="http://eyespot.com/flash/flvplayer.swf?vurl=http%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.eyespot.com%2Fplay%3Fr%3D338f45bb57c5d73508f5a123a04b9647662b0737973284b49c44b95bfe9737b82f20a14f58dff42eeab0340d647d922e6e353516bbb0241fe04e447602073383" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="323" height="263"></embed>
