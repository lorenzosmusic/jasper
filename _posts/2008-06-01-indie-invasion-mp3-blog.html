It's nice that while we're finishing up the new album that we're still getting press on the last one. Carlos at the <a href="http://indiemusicinvasion.blogspot.com/">Indie Invasion mp3 blog</a> just posted this story about our song "Down the stairway"<br /><blockquote cite="http://indiemusicinvasion.blogspot.com/"><a href="http://indiemusicinvasion.blogspot.com/" title="">  <img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3205/2538059254_dccaecc567_o.jpg" border="0" /> </a><br />I just gotta say that Lorenzo's Music is awesome. (this being the name of the band, if you where wondering) I mean what could be better than rock combined with a saxophone? Seriously? But don't let me tell you, find out for your self. </blockquote><cite cite="http://indiemusicinvasion.blogspot.com/"><a href="http://indiemusicinvasion.blogspot.com/">Indie Invasion</a></cite>
