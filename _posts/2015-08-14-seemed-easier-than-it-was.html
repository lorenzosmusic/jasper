I love it. It's come a long way since the times of crappy 4 track recordings. <br /><br />We can come to a practice and play a fully fleshed out idea. Worked on from home with drum sounds &amp; instruments already tweeked. Expressing the sound we want represented in our head.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, nothing can compare to a full band arrangement. Writing on a computer can be almost too easy sometimes.<br /><br />Mark, recorded a draft for a song. When we listened it seemed pretty straight forward. Then we tried to break it down in sections.<br /><br />The drum line on the digital sketch, while easy to program, turned out to be a complex 16 bar loop. This is where it gets interesting. <br /><br />While the beat was easy to create on screen, it was not something compatible to human coordination off the bat. Rob discovered that while trying to play it. <br /><br />This is where the merging of technology &amp; man made music is fantastic in my opinion! <br /><br />Rob, now trying to figure out this combination, is opening his skill set to a whole new approach. A rhythm he would not have come up with organically. <br /><br />This is why I don't say making music on a computer is killing creativity in music. Just don't solely rely on it. Building from it as a tool. <br /><br />-Tom
