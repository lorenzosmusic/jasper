Surprising&nbsp;i know. But here's a little story about how our last album cover was inspired by a&nbsp;liquor&nbsp;store sign from Las Vegas,&nbsp;Nevada&nbsp;(it's not as exciting as it sounds).<br /><br />Mark and I were putting the finishing touches on the album that is now our <a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/album/bazar">BAZAR</a> release. We wanted something that was like a bright neon corner of nowhere sign. So we went to Flickr and put in our keywords. Turns out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roadsidepictures/">Roadsidepictures</a>, a guy that I already follow had the best stuff.<br /><br />One of his pics in his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roadsidepictures/sets/1116714/with/2201037782/">signs set</a> was of a liquor store called "Charleston Bazar".<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roadsidepictures/2201037782/" title="Charleston Bazar by Roadsidepictures, on Flickr"><img alt="Charleston Bazar" height="320" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2104/2201037782_72ff4b68b1.jpg" width="500" /></a><br /><br />We liked that it was the same concept as our <a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/album/solamente-tres-palabras">Solamente Tres Palabras</a> album cover but a different take on it. The Solamente cover was a lone street light poking out in a blue natural gradient sky. This picture was a neon light at night doing what it does-- burning it's message in the dark, offering a promise of who knows what'll happen tonight.<br /><br />I drew up a version of it with our name in the sign to make it look like a neon sign but it never panned out just right. So I made a really gritty version of it and screen printed it to look like one of those <a href="http://flipsidefanzine.com/Flyer1981.html">old punk rock flyers</a> where they would just draw and paste words on a page.<br />Except unlike those old flyers, ours was 3 colored.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5qOA_AYdkzM/SxwROa1E6TI/AAAAAAAABLU/Av51WmvTyQA/bazar_sm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5qOA_AYdkzM/SxwROa1E6TI/AAAAAAAABLU/Av51WmvTyQA/bazar_sm.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="zemanta-related"><h6 class="zemanta-related-title" style="font-size: 1em; margin: 1em 0 0 0;">Related articles</h6><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://laughingsquid.com/melancholy-hill-by-gorillaz-animated-using-nyc-neon-signs/">Melancholy Hill by Gorillaz, Animated Using NYC Neon Signs</a> (laughingsquid.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://laist.com/2010/11/11/happy_100th_birthday_to_the_neon_si.php">Happy 100th Birthday to the Neon Sign</a> (laist.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2270357/">Photographs of broken neon signs.</a> (slate.com)</li></ul></div><div class="zemanta-pixie" style="height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;"><img alt="" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=ae9c515f-43e0-47f4-86bb-9ef4ee3938ae" style="border: none; float: right;" /></div>
