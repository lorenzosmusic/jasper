Bill Grady over at the <a href="http://www.youaretheguest.com/pods.html">"You Are The Guest" Podcast</a> recently played us on his show where they have a discussion about the future of podcasting, living in London, what life has been like after the London bombings, and how people in Britain see the Iraqi War.<br /><br />Give it a listen.
