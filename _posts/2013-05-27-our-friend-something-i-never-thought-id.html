After that night, I never saw him again. He was <a href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/Officer-involved-in-shooting-has-history-of-controversy/-/1648/17357042/-/m7fc0s/-/index.html" target="_blank">shot and killed by local police a few nights later</a>.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />He had recently moved back to town after living in New York for several years. I was looking forward to getting&nbsp;acquainted&nbsp;with him again. He was a great musician and guitar player.<br /><br />The story behind what really happened that night will always be a mystery.<br />It should have only been a crazy story that he would tell us about the next day.<br /><br />Paulie was a friend to all of us. Before Lorenzo's Music, he and our bassist Cliff used to play together in the band <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monovox" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Monovox">Monovox</a> and toured the country.<br /><br />Every day we remember him and why we miss him so.<br /><br />-tom<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.high-noon.com/event/253755-paulie-fest-madison/" target="_blank"><img alt="Paulie Fest Image" border="0" height="147" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VkseXyng9Nw/UaQVhCcUfHI/AAAAAAAAQpY/00C9hlZKMlk/s400/923164_10102108539606607_560265426_n.jpg" title="Paulie Fest June 1, 2013 - High Noon Saloon" width="400" /></a></div><br />On Saturday, June 1st we will be playing a show at the High Noon Saloon in Madison celebrating Paulie's life with these other great bands and friends of Paulie's.<br /><br /><a href="http://solidgoldband.com/" target="_blank">Solid Gold</a>,<br /><a href="http://alltinycreatures.com/" target="_blank">All Tiny Creatures</a>,<br />Lorenzo's Music,<br /><a href="http://cowboywinter.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Cowboy Winter</a><br /><b>Saturday, June 1st 2013</b><br />7:00 pm<br />at the <a href="http://www.high-noon.com/event/253755-paulie-fest-madison/" target="_blank">High Noon Saloon</a><br />$10 adv / $15 dos
