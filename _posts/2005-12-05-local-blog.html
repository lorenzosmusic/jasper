Someone just emailed me a link to a <a href="http://cometstarmoon.blogspot.com/2005/11/five-pack-of-madison-music.html">local Madison site</a> that said this:<br /><blockquote>I've been communicating with a great band out of Toronto called <a href="http://www.theghostisdancing.com/">The Ghost is Dancing</a>. One of their members asked me what the Madison music scene was like. I sent him a rather lengthy response that really got me thinking. Here I sit often struggling to find something original to write about and I live in one of the most vibrant music communities in the country. You know the cartoons where the guy steps on a rake and it up and smacks him in the face? That's how I feel right now. Why am I not writing about Madison bands? So, from here on out I am going to make a greater attempt to profile a new Madison act at least once a week. There is at least 400 of them, so I shouldn't have a problem. To start things off here is just a selection of five songs from an eclectic mix of different Madison genres.<br /><br />Charlemagne :: August Evenings<br />From the self-titled 2003 album<br />Website: <a href="http://www.beholdcharlemagne.com/">http://www.beholdcharlemagne.com</a><br />MySpace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/charlefuckingmagne">http://www.myspace.com/charlefuckingmagne</a><br /><br />Lorenzo's Music :: I'm Doing Fine<br />From the 2005 album Solamente Tres Palabras<br />Website: <a href="http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/">http://www.lorenzosmusic.com/</a><br />MySpace page:  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lorenzosmusic">http://www.myspace.com/lorenzosmusic  </a><br /><br />The Buffali :: Yer Late<br />From their 2005 album Kerfuffle No. 10<br />Website: <a href="http://www.buffali.com/">http://www.buffali.com/</a><br />MySpace: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebuffali">http://www.myspace.com/thebuffali</a><br /><br />German Art Students :: Civil War Re-Enactor<br />From their 2005 album Name Droppers<br />Website: <a href="http://www.thegermanartstudents.com/">http://www.thegermanartstudents.com/</a><br />MySpace:  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thegermanartstudents">http://www.myspace.com/thegermanartstudents </a><br /><br />el guante :: collateral Damage<br />Website: <a href="http://www.guante.net/">http://www.guante.net/</a><br />MySpace page: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/elguante">http://www.myspace.com/elguante</a><br /></blockquote>So thanks to <a href="http://cometstarmoon.blogspot.com/">calistan</a> for listing us as one of his five top Madison bands among these other great artists.
