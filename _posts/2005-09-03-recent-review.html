Here's a review of our <a href="http://lorenzosmusic.bandcamp.com/album/solamente-tres-palabras">album</a> in this weeks <a href="http://thedailypage.com/going-out/music/cdreviews/managedit.php?intcdrevid=620">Isthmus Magazine</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7YhFLbZBlfA/TmWvBRnxZeI/AAAAAAAAGho/mawG4kl_ipw/s1600/3821288233-1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7YhFLbZBlfA/TmWvBRnxZeI/AAAAAAAAGho/mawG4kl_ipw/s320/3821288233-1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><span class="headline"><br />Lorenzo's Music</span><span class="headline"><span class="body"><i>Solamente Tres Palabras </i></span></span>   <br /><table border="0" style="width: 100%px;"> <tbody><tr><td><span class="bodybig"></span><br /><span class="bodybig"><br /></span><span class="bodybig">         <br />Thanks to their taste for stumbling, off-kilter song structures and vocalist Tom Ray’s barroom rasp, Lorenzo’s Music will always draw comparisons to Tom Waits. That’s not such a bad thing, but it does sell them a bit short. While many of the tunes on Solamente Tres Palabras take their lead from the fractured updates of German cabaret music that reinvigorated Waits’ career, Lorenzo’s Music also embrace a sweeter form of pop-rock that’s all about lonely water-gazers and bruised swains dreaming of a better world.<br />   The ironical lead track, "I’m Doing Fine," is a case in point. It may prickle with low-down signifiers, but Ray’s whiskey-soaked crooning, Mark Whitcomb’s distorted guitar and Scott Beardsley’s clanking percussion don’t obscure the fact that the song’s once-wayward protagonist searches for normalcy and completeness, not the debauchery of his past. The discombobulated surfer ballad "You Were Blonde" may mock romance, but its Beach Boys-inspired melody suggests that Ray’s bleary-eyed barfly really does long for more than a meaningless assignation beneath a burned-out streetlight.<br />  Which isn’t to say that you’re apt to choose Solamente Tres Palabras for background music when cracking open a bottle of Dom with your honey and settling in for a night of romance. Most of the time, it’s not that sweet. Then again, neither is love.</span></td></tr><tr><td align="right" halign="right" valign="top"><br /><span class="bodybig"><b>Reviewed by Tom Laskin</b></span></td></tr></tbody>   </table></blockquote><br /><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>
